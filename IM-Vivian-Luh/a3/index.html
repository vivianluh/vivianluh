        <p> This browser-based interactive project showcases a small, cartooned animation that is prompted as soon as 
            the user clicks and drags their cursor around the page. The animation will move forwards or backwards in 
            relation to the position of the user's cursor and will stop on its frame as soon as the user's mouse button 
            is lifted. The animation consists of a person who seems rather dull and emotionless, however there is a 
            certain hidden frame which reveals their 'fun' side. Users are encouraged to play around with the interactive 
            animation in the hopes that when they lift their mouse up, the animation pauses on that hidden frame. 
        </p>

            The adjective and principle pairing this interactive animation reflects is Playfulness and Feedback and Agency. 
            I wanted to explore the relationship and the reaction the user has when a digital environment returns something 
            back (whether that be a signal, movement, a change in visuals) as a result of their actions. The reaction I want 
            the user to radiate is one of playfulness and glee which will only be achieved if the digital environment is clear 
            in its interactive instructions and the certain 'change' is one that has a playful and childlike aesthetic. Through 
            this, I have decided to build an interactive animation that starts and changes the direction of an animation in 
            accordance with the user's positioning of their mouse. This gives them the power to find and pause on that 'fun' hidden 
            frame in the hopes that they find pleasure in an inherently amusing animation, forming a playful way of exerting the most 
            out of the animation and the user's agency. With this interaction, hopefully the animation visuals and emotive goals are 
            presented in the best light. The utilisation of a bold and bright colour palette and the simple cartooned artistic style aims to strengthen the playful 
            aesthetic that is frequently seen in a variety of different cartoons and is directly inspired by the cartooning seen by Matt 
            Groening. Moreover, the 'Information' button at the top left of the browser and the written instructions are also animated 
            to push for this aesthetic. The utilisation of a bold and bright colour palette and the simple cartooned artistic style aims

            This art piece explores a variety of technical implementations to create a fully-fledged moving animation, such as using 
            <code>arrays</code> and <code>setInterval</code> to establish movement. In order to enact the moving frames, I referenced 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/d66W0P8foI0">this tutorial</a> which went through setting up a setInterval function that moved 
            the frames forwards and backwards. Instead of trying to track a video utilising the user's mouse, the implementation of 
            frames was a much more orderly process. To build user interactivity, I wanted the user's mouse/trackpad to be the main output 
            for this as it is one of the most used key amongst digital environments. When facilitating this, I used a series of event 
            listeners to call for a <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event to authorise a Boolean variable for the user's position 
            to then reference the setInterval functions I had already established. These technical design decisions were the most efficient 
            in planning out and enacting the interactive elements and in creating a workflow that was succinct and ordered.

      <!-- BUTTON AND INSTRUCTION ELEMENTS -->

      <!-- I decided to keep within the animation style by also making sure the instructions at the top of the webpage and 
        the information button at the top left were also animated. This was done through exported gifs and placed in its respective
        places as it was the most time-efficient way to implement this style. 

        The hand-drawn cartooned style of these elements strengthened the overall playful aesthetic of the webpage as it matched
        the art style of the animation (use of bold black ink outline and simple line work).

<!-- TESTING USING BUTTONS -->
    <!-- These commented out buttons were utilised to build the interactive art piece in a step-by-step manner, allowing me 
    to easily and confidently understand the process for establishing this particular interactivity. Before setting up the
    mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup events, I utilised the buttons to first enact any sought of animation movements to ensure
    these functions worked first. This process allowed me to work in sections in a efficient and controlled manner.
