      <!-- Stylistically, the goal was to create a media playback that looked sleek, professional, 
           and clean, drawing inspiration from the layout and visual presentation of Youtube, Vimeo, 
           and online design portfolios that present examples of video works to their clients.  -->

      <!-- As the display was in flexbox, I decided to move both the mute button and full screen button
      to the right of the video player. This was to ensure the play/pause button is its stand alone feature 
      (highlighting how I believe this is the most important feature of a video player when users interact with the playback buttons as 
      it essentially controls whether the user wants to watch or stop watching). This was directly motivated by the layout of vimeo
      which has the play/pause button by itself on the left. I believe this also informs users of a hierarchy of which buttons should 
      be utilised to most to least and as a result the play/pause button is the most important feature of the video player. -->

        <!-- I believe the fullscreen feature is the most appropriate choice for my media player. As I am motivated to create
        a media playback that draws inspiration from a portfolio/showcase, the full screen button will allow viewers to consume 
        the media at their fullest attention and minimise distraction. The media consists of music and animations, so allowing users to
        have the choice of focusing just on the visual and audio of the media will ensure the media itself is maximised. -->
