/* NAVIGATION LIST FEEDBACK
To provide some important user interaction, I focused on implementing the :hover and :active pseudo-classes to 
the navigation list to ensure users are well informed of where exactly they want to navigate to. As users hover over
any section of the navigation list the list will change colour to yellow and as a result that section is highlighted. 
A transition property was added to ensure the change in colour from black to yellow is done smoothly as I thought without 
it the change felt jarring. 

The cursor also changes from the mouse icon to the pointer icon to further inform users that by clicking this highlighted
part of the list, the website will direct itself to that particular section. 

The :active pseudo-class was employed at the end of the users interaction where by clicking the particular section, the highlighted
part of the list turns blue. This is to ensure users know that they have in fact clicked the section. These simple user interactions
ensure easy navigation of the entire website, employed in a way that the user hopefully doesn't even know these changes in interactions
are happening.

Again, simple user interactions were added to the buttons surrounding the page. I took the same skills utilised in the navigation

the whole webpage.

looked neat and tidy. Again the :hover and :active pseudo-classes were used in conjunction with colour to keep within the design
aesthetics/colour palette of the website.

First, the colour of the circle was animated to add interest to the throbber. The changing of the circle size was
employed to symbolise that the page was loading, as this movement is universally known as some sought of loading 
procedure of a webpage. 

Aesthetically, I decided to place the load throbber behind the title of Haruomi Hosono and size it up so it 
represented the Japanese flag, for which Hosono is from. As Hosono is known for his influence in modern Japanese pop
and his psychedelic beginnings, I decided to utilise an electric neon color palette. The three colours are inspired by his
'Tropical Dandy' album cover.
